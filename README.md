# code-nest

A collaborative coding platform for pair programming and code reviews, built on Stacks blockchain using Clarity smart contracts.

## Overview

Code Nest is a decentralized platform that facilitates collaborative coding sessions and code reviews between developers. Built on the Stacks blockchain, it provides a trustless environment for developers to connect, collaborate, and earn rewards for their expertise.

## Core Features

- **Collaborative Coding Sessions**: Real-time pair programming sessions with secure payment handling
- **Code Review System**: Decentralized code review marketplace with bounties
- **Reputation System**: Track and verify developer expertise across languages and domains
- **Payment Infrastructure**: Built-in escrow, bounties, and tipping mechanisms

## Smart Contract Architecture

The platform consists of four main smart contracts:

### Code Nest Sessions (`code-nest-sessions`)
- Manages collaborative coding sessions between developers
- Handles session creation, joining, and completion
- Tracks session feedback and ratings
- Implements dispute resolution mechanisms

### Code Nest Reviews (`code-nest-reviews`)
- Facilitates code review submissions and feedback
- Tracks review quality metrics
- Maintains permanent records of review history
- Enables structured feedback across multiple dimensions

### Code Nest Reputation (`code-nest-reputation`)
- Builds comprehensive developer reputation profiles
- Tracks expertise by language, framework, and domain
- Manages skill endorsements and ratings
- Calculates reputation scores based on platform activity

### Code Nest Payments (`code-nest-payments`)
- Handles all payment-related functionality
- Implements secure escrow for sessions
- Manages review bounties and payments
- Provides tipping mechanisms

## Key Functions

### Sessions
```clarity
;; Create a new coding session
(create-session (provider principal) (amount uint))

;; Join an existing session
(join-session (session-id uint))

;; Confirm session completion
(confirm-session-completion (session-id uint))
```

### Reviews
```clarity
;; Submit code for review
(submit-code (repo-url (string-utf8 256)) (commit-hash (string-utf8 64)))

;; Create a review request with bounty
(create-review-request (reviewer principal) (bounty uint))

;; Complete a review
(complete-review (review-id uint))
```

### Reputation
```clarity
;; Register a new user
(register-user)

;; Add or update a skill
(add-skill (skill-name (string-ascii 64)) (category uint))

;; Endorse a user's skill
(endorse-skill (endorsed-user principal) (skill-name (string-ascii 64)))
```

### Payments
```clarity
;; Send a tip to a developer
(send-tip (recipient principal) (amount uint))

;; Create a session with payment in escrow
(create-session (provider principal) (amount uint))

;; Create a review request with bounty
(create-review-request (reviewer principal) (bounty uint))
```

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies for Clarity development
3. Deploy the contracts to the Stacks blockchain
4. Interact with the contracts using the provided functions

## Security Considerations

- All monetary transactions use secure escrow mechanisms
- Dispute resolution systems are built into session management
- Rating and feedback systems have validation checks
- Platform fees are transparently handled
- Admin functions are properly access-controlled
